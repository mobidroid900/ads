You play as Miller Clark, he's freshly out of the Empire after being conscripted. This is one of the first open-world maps on Minecraft Bedrock to have a protagonist. This map also features voice acting and cutscenes! Miller Clark is looking for a new line of work and not interested in the traditional ways of work. Rinson, an old friend of Miller is eagerly waiting for him to come back so they can start their \"work\". See Star Wars never seen before in this Open World game where you take in the eyes of Miller and his criminal experience across the galaxy! It takes on a more mature style on Star Wars!</p>\n<figure class=\"image\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"lazyLoad isLoaded\" style=\"width: 319px; height: 156px;\" src=\"https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/96216/images/star-wars-imperial-rain-open-world-story-sandbox_2.jpeg\" /></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Maps</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are three open planets seen in the films!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Coruscant</p>\n<figure class=\"image\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"lazyLoad isLoaded\" style=\"width: 320px; height: 180px;\" src=\"https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/95069/images/star-wars-imperial-rain-open-world-story-sandbox_3.jpeg\" /></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tatooine</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bespin</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They also have iconic locations seen in the films!</p>\n<figure class=\"image\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"lazyLoad isLoaded\" style=\"width: 322px; height: 181px;\" src=\"https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/95069/images/star-wars-imperial-rain-open-world-story-sandbox_7.jpeg\" /></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Content</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are many blasters you can purchase in-game that are seen in the films.

The temple is almost accurately recreated to look like a real one, outside it you will find two buttons. One button resets the map if you ever mess up and want to start over again. You have the choice to loot the temple with nothing at all since it is very much possible, but if you want to have the ideal tools you want for a speedrun, press the other button.</p>\n<p><img class=\"lazyLoad isLoaded\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/96028/images/temple-speedrunning-practice_5.jpeg\" width=\"331\" height=\"149\" /></p>\n</div>\n</div>"
